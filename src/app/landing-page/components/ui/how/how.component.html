          We have built what is probably the best visualisation platform for
          marketing data out there. We have also added smooth connections with
          most major digital marketing channels, so that our users can easily
          fetch and view their own data. On top of this, we have added clever
          layers of publicly available data, to show how businesses are impacted
          by external factors, providing an eye-opening view on any marketing
          driven SME.
        </p>
